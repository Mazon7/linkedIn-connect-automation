Project of Automation LinkedIn connection process

In this project I automate the process of connection to LinkedIn by sending the predefined messages to people basing on several conditions.

I used Selenium, BeautifulSoup and some other default Python libraries to make it happen.
The script takes the CSV file with data as an input (data can be added manually or being a result file from the previous runs) and outputs the processed CSV result file.
There is also some logging implemented as .txt file that created after script execution. It can be useful for understanding the process, or in case some errors arises.  

The requirements of the task is specified in Description.docx It might be a little bit outdated, but contains the main point.
